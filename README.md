Calories Burnt Prediction with Machine Learning üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüî•

This repository contains a machine learning project implemented in Python for predicting calories burnt during physical activities. The predictive model utilizes a dataset of various physical activity records to train and evaluate its accuracy.

Features:

-Machine Learning Models: Implementations of popular machine learning algorithms for regression tasks, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

-Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the input data to ensure accurate predictions.

-Evaluation Metrics: Utilize metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of the models.

-Visualization: Visualize the results and model performance using graphs and charts.

Dataset:

The project uses a dataset that includes information about different physical activities, including duration, intensity, and user profiles. The dataset is included in the 'Calories' and 'Exercise' directory.
